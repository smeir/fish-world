FishWorld is a simple and amusing point and click game.

Fishes come from both sides of the screen. The goal of the game is to let no fish through to the other side. You get points for every fish you kill (left click). The more points you get, the faster the game will be. So it becomes more difficult the longer you play. You have three sticks of dynamite you can use to kill all fishes currently on the screen (right click). Use it wisely. When you achieve a highscore, the score is saved but only for the current session.
